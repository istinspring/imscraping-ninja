Personal website build with `HTML/SCSS/RiotJS/Webapack` using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator.

In this version i decided to give Material Components Web a try, since they're not bind to any framework and
use Yandex's BEM for tagging it was very easy to integrate them into the existed templates. Also Hugo is awesome!
